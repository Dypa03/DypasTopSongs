# Dypa's Top Songs

Hi everyone, hope you guys are having a good day!
This is a very simple React static page I realized just to have practice with React props and to review CSS a bit. 

I want to thank the Scrimba Discord community, they gave A LOT(too much, I don't deserve this) of insights about the design of the page and I can't really express how much I'm thankful for it.
Feel free to share any advice, both on the design and the code side, I really care about getting better so any tip is gold for me.

Hope you like it!
